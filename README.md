Hello! This repository is my playground for learning the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) engine written in Rust ðŸ¦€. Physics is powered by the [Rapier plugin](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier).

### Features
- Marching Cubes compute shader to polygonize a scalar field (this means ~1 ms 32x32x32 chunk generation on i9 + 1080 Ti!)
- Source engine inspired movement, allowing air strafing and bunny hopping

### Demo
